We want to maximize $${\sigma_0 \left({n}\right) \over n}$$ or equivalently $${\prod \left({i + 1}\right) \over \sum {i ln p_i}}$$, so we want to minimize $$\sum {i ln p_i}$$.  I thought this would be best achieved by making the power of each prime approximately proportional to the reciprocal of its logarithm, so I tried this.  It wasn't perfect, but it was pretty close.  So the number of primes needed is n - 1 where n makes $${7999999^{1/n} \over 2 ln p_n}$$ less than 0.5.  I plugged in numbers and n - 1 should be 12 because then that expression is less than 0.5.  Then I calculated the approximate powers for the first 12 primes using the formula $$p_i^{7999999^{1/12} \over 2 ln p_i}$$.  I got $$2^{2.713},3^{1.712},5^{1.168},7^{0.966},11^{0.784},13^{0.733},17^{0.664},19^{0.639},23^{0.600},29^{0.558},31^{0.548},37^{0.521}$$, so I started at $$2^3 3^2 5^1 ...$$ and added powers until I got to $$2^3 3^3 5^2 7^2 11^1 ...$$, which worked.  I'm not really sure why my inverse log trick didn't really work, but oh well.
