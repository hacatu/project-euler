Consider representing a quadrilateral as 5 angles: a, b, c, d, e.  With one diagonal horizontal,
a is the angle between it and the top left side, and b, c, and d are the angles immediately after
the other corners going clockwise.  e is the angle between the horizontal diagonal and the bottom left
side.  Let Q = (a, b, c, d, e).  Let R refer to rotation once counterclockwise, so
R (a, b, c, d, e) = (b, c, d, a, 180 - a - d - e).  Let M refer to mirroring over the vertical line, so
M (a, b, c, d, e) = (d + e - b, 180 - a - d - e, e, 180 - c - d - e, c)
We want to find a function g from quadrilaterals Q to booleans so that
forall Q, i, j: g Q & g M^i*R^j*Q -> Q = M^i*R^j*Q and
forall Q: thereexists i, j: g M^i*R^j*Q

Consider g (a, b, c, d, e) =
	d + e < 90 & c < a
	           & c = a & d < b
	                   & d = b & e <= d
	d + e = 90 & a - d > b - a, c - b, d - c & a + d > 90
	                                         & a + d = 90 & b + c >= 90
	           & a - d = b - a > c - b >= d - c
	           & a - d = c - b > b - a >= d - c
	           & a - d = b - a = d - c >= c - b

Proof that g Q & g RQ -> Q == RQ:
	Have: g (a, b, c, d, e) & g (b, c, d, a, 180 - a - d - e).
	Want: a = b = c = d & d + e = 90
	The sum of the last two angles is <= 90 in all cases of g
		d + e <= 90 & a + 180 - a - e <= 90
		d + e <= 90 <= d + e
		d + e = 90
	In all cases of g where d + e = 90, the leftmost angle of Q is the largest so
		a - d >= b - a, c - b, d - c & b - a >= c - b, d - c, a - d
		a - d = b - a >= c - b, d - c
	This means the transformed quadrilateral has its left and bottom angles as its largest.
	This is only permissible in g if its top angle is also its largest so we get
		a - d = b - a = c - b >= d - c
	The only case for Q where this is permissible is when
		a - d = b - a = c - b = d - c
	a + 90 - d, b + 90 - a, c + 90 - b, d + 90 - d are the angles of the quadrilateral so they add
	up to 360.  Subtracting 90 from each we find
		a - d + b - a + c - b + d - c = 0.  But a - d = b - a = c - b = d - c so
		a - d = b - a = c - b = d - c = 0.  So a = b = c = d as desired.  Furthermore (because we will use
		this result later),
